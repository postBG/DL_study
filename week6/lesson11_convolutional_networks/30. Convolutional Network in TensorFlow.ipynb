    "# 30. Convolutional Network in TensorFlow\n",
    "It's time to walk through an example Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of this network follows the classic structure of CNNs, which is a mix of convolutional layers and max pooling, followed by fully-connected layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code you'll be looking at is similar to what you saw in the segment on [Deep Neural Network in TensorFlow](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd009/parts/c983b707-8f75-4c5e-8567-7134e21e5a65/modules/24611a52-b490-497c-aaba-47db1f4ef3fd/lessons/cb4ae92e-abf2-49c9-afae-e497dd25f3fb/concepts/43664323-f76e-4b3d-8cde-5ad0c8345d1c#), except we restructured the architecture of this network as a CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in that segment, here you'll study the line-by-line breakdown of the code. If you want, you can even [download the code](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/February/58a61ca1_cnn/cnn.zip) and run it yourself.\n",

    "The above is an example of a convolution with a 3x3 filter and a stride of 1 being applied to data with a range of 0 to 1. \n",
    "The convolution for each 3x3 section is calculated against the weight, **[[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]]**, then a bias is added to create the convolved feature on the right. In this case, the bias is zero. In TensorFlow, this is all done using **tf.nn.conv2d()** and **tf.nn.bias_add()**.\n",

    "The **tf.nn.conv2d()** function computes the convolution against weight **W** as shown above.\n",
    "\n",
    "In TensorFlow, **strides** is an array of 4 elements; the first element in this array indicates the stride for batch and last element indicates stride for features. It's good practice to remove the batches or features you want to skip from the data set rather than use a stride to skip them. *You can always set the first and last element to 1 in **strides** in order to use all batches and features*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The middle two elements are the strides for height and width respectively. I've mentioned stride as one number because you usually have a square stride where **height = width**. When someone says they are using a stride of 3, they usually mean **tf.nn.conv2d(x, W, strides=[1, 3, 3, 1])**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make life easier, the code is using **tf.nn.bias_add()** to add the bias. Using **tf.add()** doesn't work when the tensors aren't the same shape."

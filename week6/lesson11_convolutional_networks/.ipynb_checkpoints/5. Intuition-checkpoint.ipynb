Thus, one way of classifying a Retriever’s nose is to to break it up into smaller pieces and look for black holes (nostrils) and curves that define an oval as shown below.\n",

    "In our case, the levels in the hierarchy are:\n",

    "A CNN might have several layers, and each layer might capture a different level in the hierarchy of objects. The first layer is the lowest level in the hierarchy, where the CNN generally classifies small parts of the image into simple shapes like horizontal and vertical lines and simple blobs of colors. The subsequent layers tend to be higher levels in the hierarchy and generally classify more complex ideas like shapes (combinations of lines), and eventually full objects like dogs."

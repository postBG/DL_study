    "Good job! You've accomplished a lot. In particular, you did the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Ran operations in tf.Session.\n",
    "    - Created a constant tensor with tf.constant().\n",
    "    - Used tf.placeholder() and feed_dict to get input.\n",
    "    - Applied the tf.add(), tf.subtract(), tf.multiply(), and tf.divide() functions using numeric data.\n",
    "    - Learned about casting between types with tf.cast()\n",
    "    \n",
    "You know the basics of TensorFlow, so let's take a break and get back to the theory of neural networks. In the next few videos, you're going to learn about one of the most popular applications of neural networks - classification."

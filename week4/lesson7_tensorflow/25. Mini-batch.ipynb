    "In this section, you'll go over what mini-batching is and how to apply it in TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mini-batching is a technique for training on subsets of the dataset instead of all the data at one time. This provides the ability to train a model, even if a computer lacks the memory to store the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mini-batching is computationally inefficient, since you can't calculate the loss simultaneously across all samples. However, this is a small price to pay in order to be able to run the model at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also quite useful combined with SGD. The idea is to randomly shuffle the data at the start of each epoch, then create the mini-batches. For each mini-batch, you train the network weights with gradient descent. Since these batches are random, you're performing SGD with each batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the MNIST dataset with weights and a bias to see if your machine can handle it."

    "In order to use mini-batching, you must first divide your data into batches.\n",

    "Unfortunately, it's sometimes impossible to divide the data into batches of exactly equal size. For example, imagine you'd like to create batches of 128 samples each from a dataset of 1000 samples. Since 128 does not evenly divide into 1000, you'd wind up with 7 batches of 128 samples, and 1 batch of 104 samples. (7*128 + 1*104 = 1000)\n",

    "\n",
    "Continuing the example, if each sample had **n_input = 784** features and **n_classes = 10** possible labels, the dimensions for features would be **[None, n_input]** and labels would be **[None, n_classes]**.\n",

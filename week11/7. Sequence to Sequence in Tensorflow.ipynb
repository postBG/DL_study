    "\n",
    "Tensorflow has a bunch of APIs that help you build a sequence to sequence model (also called a seq2seq model for short). It’s important to note that these APIs have changed at the end of 2016 (and in a way are still evolving). A lot of the tutorials you’ll find on the web for seq2seq in tensorflow use the now-deprecated **tf.contrib.legacy_seq2seq** (which was previously called “**tf.nn.seq2seq**”)."
